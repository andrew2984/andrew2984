## About Me

At the beginning of December, I was enrolled in a software engineering bootcamp that is funded by the Department of Education. Although the selection process was very competitive and required me to learn Python to create projects, I was successful in my application. The bootcamp is intended to be completed by 5th March, but I have worked ahead of pace and finished in two weeks on 15th December. Despite this pace and having no access to guided lectures for most topics, I have managed to maintain an average grade of 99% by diligently incorporating feedback into my later projects. This shows my commitment and dedication to programming as well as my capability and eagerness to learn. Evidence of the statements can be viewed [here](https://www.hyperiondev.com/portfolio/119179/).
